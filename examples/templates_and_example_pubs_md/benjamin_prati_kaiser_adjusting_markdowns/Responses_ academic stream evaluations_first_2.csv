1. Write an evaluation, up to the standards of a high-quality referee report for a traditional journal.  Consider standard guidelines as well as The Unjournal’s emphases.  Please try to address any specific considerations mentioned in our bespoke evaluation notes, and any specific requests from the evaluation manager.
2. Give quantitative metrics and predictions.
3. Identify and assess the ‘most important claim’ of the research.
4. Answer a short questionnaire about your background and our processes.

Compensation: As a sign that we value this work, we compensate invited evaluators for prompt evaluations. Oct. 2025: we currently target $350 in compensation per on-time complete evaluation on average, including incentives and prizes. If you have been invited, the specific honorarium details should have been made clear to you. Consult and query our knowledge base for our updated compensation policies.

(Internal note 22 June 2025: We’ve been building a better-formatted form via the  PubPub Platform tool. However, their development is paused/frozen due to funding issues.)



“Independent evaluators”: We’re  exploring an “independent evaluations” trial (see linked details). If you are doing this as an independent evaluation (i.e., you were not explicitly commissioned by The Unjournal to evaluate this paper), please see the explicit guidance here  on how to use this form as an independent evaluator.

* 0.0: Marginally respectable/Little to no value
* 1.0: OK/Somewhat valuable
* 2.0: Marginal B-journal/Decent field journal
* 3.0: Top B-journal/Strong field journal
* 4.0: Marginal A-Journal/Top field journal

See the discussion of “journal ranking tiers” in our guidelines for more details, with some linked examples. We ask you to not just use integers, but to consider these to be on a continuous scale. E.g., “3.5” represents a journal that ranks halfway between a ‘top field journal' and a ‘strong field journal’.
