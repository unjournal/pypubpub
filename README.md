# Configuring PubPub API (V6) for The Unjournal

1. To be useable and clearly understand what functions do

- to enable ad-hoc adjustments and bulk fixes
- to build other functionality and integrations

2. To try to automate The Unjournal's production process

- Mainly building the 'evaluation packages'

- Also to build metadata files for RePEc
- Enable other feeds and updates (e.g., evaluation data reporting)

3. Usage: See the 'tests/' directory. The requirements for access are Pubpub information: community_id, community_url, email, password. To find out Pubpub Ids such as the community_id see the FAQ at: https://github.com/pubpub/sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#faq , which recommends the PubPub ID Finder:  https://pubpub.tefkah.com/
