# Configuring PubPub API (V6) for The Unjournal

1. To be useable and clearly understand what functions do

- to enable ad-hoc adjustments and bulk fixes
- to build other functionality and integrations

2. To try to automate The Unjournal's production process

- Mainly building the 'evaluation packages'

- Also to build metadata files for RePEc
- Enable other feeds and updates (e.g., evaluation data reporting)

## Project management

### Scratch work on fixes

https://testabcd123456789.pubpub.org/pub/nudgesincreasewelfare6648/draft

- Need quotes around paper title (fancy -- replace quotation marks in title with single quotes)

- Need to be able to specify multiple authors
    - for evaluation summary this is evaluator 1, evaluator 2, ..., eval. manager 1 (eval. manager 2)

- Evaluations
    - title should include the evaluation number... 'evaluation 1 of [papertitle]'
    - connection ... it should also be listed as 'review of the ' [original research]
