Title: Evaluation 2 of "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: This paper reports an RCT of a taxpayer education campaign in Togo, showing increased tax knowledge, a shift in the distribution of tax payments, and higher reported revenues. The reviewer finds the study valuable in its focus on small firms and the large tax knowledge effects. It offers suggestions concerning measurement bias due to enumerator involvement in the intervention, accountability measures, and interpretation of payment effects.

Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"[1]. Both evaluations are generally positive (journal tier ratings approaching "top field journal"), and also offer critiques and suggestions for improvement. Both evaluators provide suggestions for the interpretation of the results and their implications, request more detail, especially about the treatment delivery, and express concerns with sample size and power.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: This paper uses a randomized experiment among informal firms in Togo to explore how civic tax information affects compliance and economic activity. While overall tax participation falls, the intervention leads to more accurate self-reporting among larger firms and economic expansion among smaller ones. The findings challenge standard views on tax education and offer novel insights into state"firm dynamics in low-capacity settings. With some clarifications, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "A systematic review and meta analysis of social safety nets, women's economic achievements and agency"
Abstract: The paper helpfully reviews the impact of social safety nets (SSNs) on gender inequality. It highlights that SSNs can enhance women's economic achievements and agency, particularly through increased labour force participation and decision-making power. However, the effects on care work intensity are not significant. The cost-benefit analysis is limited due to a lack of comprehensive data. The paper is an excellent resource, but needs some improvements on policy suggestions.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Ends versus Means: Kantians, Utilitarians, and Moral Decisions"
Abstract: I greatly appreciated theEnds vs Meanspaper, especially its effort to bring moral dilemmas into economics. I see two main limitations in the current version of the paper: (1) the Save a Life dilemma may mischaracterize Kant"s categorical imperative; (2) the finding of unstable deontological preferences may depend on the dilemmas used. I hope these issues will be resolved, as I think this paper has high potential.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Forecasts estimate limited cultured meat production through 2050"
Abstract: My evaluation focused on assessing the assumptions and providing up-to-date context and background for the forecasting paper. The paper (post) was published in 2022, and relied on 2020-2021 data. Since then, at least eight cultivated meat (CM) products have been approved, claimed costs are below $20/kg, CM researchers exceed 250, and total funding surpassed $3B, coming from VC, public research funding, and philanthropic organisations.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Forecasts estimate limited cultured meat production through 2050"
Abstract: The review finds Rethink Priorities" 2022 cultured meat forecast methodologically sound but limited and misleading. It critiques the pessimistic framing, exclusion of luxury-product adoption, and potential premature impact on funding. Despite uncertainty on mass scale by 2050, falling input costs and emerging luxury markets suggest greater promise than implied. Still, success depends on scaling, adoption, and investment.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Maternal cash transfers for gender equity and child development: Experimental evidence from India"
Abstract: This is a timely study that adds insight into whether and how unconditional cash transfers to mothers can improve their health and the health and development of their children in a low resource setting in India. Major comments include the need to think through equitable authorship, further describe certain aspects of the intervention (i.e., messaging provided to participants), and add detail to the methods around the use of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Irrigation Strengthens Climate Resilience: Long-term Evidence from Mali using Satellites and Surveys"
Abstract: This was a very interesting paper with evident care taken to use novel data sources for careful analysis of irrigation and climate resilience. This paper uses detailed data on the exact boundaries of irrigated sites in Northern Mali combined with remotely-sensed data on farm production, water availability, vegetation condition, precipitation, and temperature to estimate the impact of these small-scale, river-based, irrigation investments on agricultural output.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Irrigation Strengthens Climate Resilience: Long-term Evidence from Mali using Satellites and Surveys"
Abstract: One of the article"s strengths is offering a longer time horizon of analysis of smallholder irrigation, which gives insights beyond localized case studies or pilot plots. Another value is that the authors connect spatial data across water, agriculture and nutrition, to provide insight beyond water efficiency or yield gains. The analysis on longer-term livelihood outcomes may be beneficial for potential decision-making on irrigation policy.However, the article has shortcomings in terms of causal factors and control areas for comparison.

Abstract: The experiment is a well-designed example of geographic randomization to measure the treatment effects of an advertising campaign.The authors demonstrate a marginally significant ATE.  They also demonstrate large, positive, significant spillover effects across geographically close postal codes, indicating that their ATE is a lower bound on the truth.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Does online fundraising increase charitable giving? A nationwide field experiment on Facebook"
Abstract: This is a large-scale, well-executed field experiment on Facebook ads for charitable giving in Germany. Randomized at the postal code level, the study finds that the campaign increased donations both short- and medium-term, without reducing future giving to the same charity"but possibly crowding out donations to others. Content and delivery method had no differential effect. The design is strong and materials are fully replicable.
