Title: Evaluation 1 of "Accelerating Vaccine Innovation for Emerging Infectious Diseases via Parallel Discovery"
Abstract:  This is an evaluation of "Accelerating Vaccine Innovation for Emerging Infectious Diseases via Parallel Discovery". [Extract from the evaluator’s summary follows.]  This is an advance on the literature, a promising foundation for future research. In its current form I do not find it convincing as a model of the future of vaccine development, and I am very skeptical of its repeated claims that the portfolio will have a 66% chance of preventing a major ‘Disease X’ pandemic, because the paper does not provide enough information about how it simulates the development of these vaccines for a previously unknown pathogen. However, it provides some insight in its current form (it shows that challenge trials, while potentially helpful, are not sufficient to solve the problem), and there are several minor extensions that could make it much more useful.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Accelerating Vaccine Innovation for Emerging Infectious Diseases via Parallel Discovery"
Abstract:  This paper tackles an important global priority area. The main limitations are the premise being restricted to private sector investment, and parameter values used. A societal perspective including (up to 100%) publicly owned efforts, and different reasonable parameter value assumptions, including optimising number of vaccine candidates in relation to expected outbreaks and infections, would alter the conclusions. Calculating cost per QALY gained, and in relation to current healthcare expenditure, would further strengthen the paper.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "The Benefits and Costs of Guest Worker Programs: Experimental Evidence from the India-UAE Migration Corridor"
Abstract: This is an evaluation of “The Benefits and Costs of Guest Worker Programs: Experimental Evidence from the India-UAE Migration Corridor”. The evaluator summarizes this as follows: The key contributions of this paper are its analysis of intermediary costs of migration, migrant well-being and diversity in the workplace, expectations of job-seekers and joint comparisons of various pecuniary and non-pecuniary measures of migration. A major limitation is the lack of a welfare justification for randomisation and little to no discussion on equipoise. My suggestions largely revolve around improvements to the discussion of methodology, representativeness, attrition and representation of treatment effects.

Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "When do "Nudges" Increase Welfare?"
Abstract: We organized two evaluations of the paper: "When do "Nudges" Increase Welfare?".  The evaluators agree that the paper provides a novel, valuable contribution to the understanding of how nudges impact welfare in equilibrium. They acknowledge the paper’s substantive theoretical modeling and its tentative empirical validation. Nonetheless, they highlight several limitations.  To read these evaluations, please see the links below.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "When do "Nudges" Increase Welfare?"
Abstract: The present paper reports on nudges failing to improve utilitarian welfare because they increase higher-order choice distortions. While the paper is highly complex in practically all regards, their general idea is important for public policy. The welfare losses implied by nudges may not be large, and real-life policymaking emphatically does not proceed by maximizing utilitarian welfare, but this paper could represent a step forward in how we think about policy incidence over the whole distribution of behaviors.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "When do "Nudges" Increase Welfare?"
Abstract: This is a very strong and interesting paper. More consideration of the welfare impacts of nudges is to be welcomed, and there is clearly a gap in the market for considering heterogeneous effects. However, there are concerns about whether or not the experimental method is really designed to answer questions of this type.
