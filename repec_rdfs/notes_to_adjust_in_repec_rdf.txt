Things to adjust in repec rdf file

Aside: all pubs should have DOIs, not just the evaluation summary thing. This was the case in the earlier evaluations. But this is because they are missing in the PubPub. Apparently we need to request a DOI for the children and not just the parent.

27 May 2024 -- I am adding these manually for now


1. Ordering -- these should be grouped by the research the package pertains to (eval summary of X, evaluation 1 of X, evaluation 2 of X,... author response to ... X) This is not super high-value though. Note this also affects the 'Number' slug thing

2. It shows 'Author-Name: Unjournal Admin (NA)' -- should only show people listed as having 'byline attribution'
