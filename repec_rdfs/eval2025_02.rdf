Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks"
Abstract: Understanding the health impacts of tree planting and re-greening is central to understanding the co-benefits and costs of climate and biodiversity-focused policy.  The paper "Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks" begins to address this question in a context in which the climate and biodiversity benefits may be small compared to the more immediate health effects: the re-greening of a mega city. We organized two evaluations of this paper.  The two evaluations both recognise the significance of the work, but diverge in their assessment of the paper's causal identification. Nonetheless, this does not diminish from the paper's important impact implications: urban regreening has large positive impacts through substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations despite increases in allergic reactions to the increased pollen loads.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks"
Abstract: The paper tackles a very interesting and relevant question about the environmental and health impact of urban forests i.e how human-led greening of urban areas affects well-being through its impact on pollution and pollen. The paper's strength lies in bringing together several data sources with high spatial resolution and decomposing the policy impact into vegetation density and greenery, air quality and finally health. Moreover the discussion on health and environment trade off is also new and insightful. The main critique is that claims of causality in the paper are not substantiated within the current estimation framework. However, I believe with the excellent data sources available to the authors this can be addressed in the future.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks"
Abstract: This is an excellent, thorough, and well-written paper on an important topic of urban greenery and health. The methodology builds on well-established methods and is convincing with ample placebo and robustness checks. The authors could further improve policy impact by expanding on the external validity of these findings by describing, exploring, and empirically characterizing the setting and MMP further: what contributes to its success, what greenery is used, and how is the greenery planted?

Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science and Technology"
Abstract: We organized one evaluation of the paper: "Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science and Technology". From the evaluation:  "This paper introduces a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing research when producing new works. [It] applies this framework to scientific publications and patents and documents a phenomenon called the 'pivot penalty' ... the impact of new research steeply declining the further a researcher moves from their prior work. This finding holds across different researchers, fields, and measurements of research impact."According to this evaluator, the paper's  strengths include "its broad applicability, strong data, and policy implications ... Should the government and universities encourage researchers to address important but remote questions? Should scientists pursue the hotspots of the scientific landscape and adapt to demands driven by funding or other reasons?"  The evaluator's concerns include "under-explored benefits of pivoting, alternative explanation[s] such as timing of rewards, evolving journal preferences, and the choice of journals over fields for analysis."

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science and Technology"
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the degree of departure from prior research in new works, documenting the "pivot penalty", where the impact of research declines as scientists venture further from their past focus. The strengths include its broad applicability, strong data, and policy implications. Concerns include under-explored benefits of pivoting, alternative explanation[s] such as [the] timing of rewards, evolving journal preferences, and the choice of journals over fields for analysis.

Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "Stagnation and Scientific Incentives"
Abstract: We organized one evaluation of the paper: "Stagnation and Scientific Incentives".  The paper implies that this "stagnation" is attributable to the rise of citation-based bibliometrics. To read this evaluation, please see the link below.  The evaluator argues that this paper "lacks sufficient support [for] its claims", and "struggles in terms of accuracy, novelty, and generalizability". He recommends  "a discussion of the difference between citation indices and journal lists [and] ...  how they impact scientist evaluations", "a comparison to non-scientific fields", some "regression model[s] or statistical tests" and "formal definitions of the terms at hand (e.g. scientific play, exploration, breakthrough, giant, etc.)"

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Stagnation and Scientific Incentives"
Abstract: I think this paper raises an excellent point, but lacks sufficient support of its claims. I think the most important aspect of this paper is its overall ethos to do right by science, but struggles in terms of accuracy, novelty, and generalizability---all of which are discussed further in my report below.
