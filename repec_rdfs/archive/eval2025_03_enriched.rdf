Title: Evaluation 1 of "Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions"
Abstract: Strengths- Proposes an empirically novel approach to answer highly policy-relevant questions- Provides a sound overall methodology which is tractable and replicableCritiques- Trained model does not enable prediction into the future given currently observed conditions- Predictions do not represent pure biophysical potential despite being framed as such- Regrowth longevity is not addressed- Policy targeting implications qualified by additionality and opportunity costs

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions"
Abstract: This paper aims to model and predict the global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions for 2016 and 2030, respectively, using a machine learning random forest (RF) approach. The studyâs aim and methods are novel and important, given the potential benefits of natural regeneration on carbon sequestration (amongst many other ecological and environmental outcomes) and the lack of pan-tropical analysis.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Choose Your Moments: NIH Peer Review and Scientific Risk Taking"
Abstract: This paper includes two experiments aimed at informing reform in the NIH grant peer review process. The first experiment finds that biomedical scientists have a preference for studies with higher score variance (âdissensusâ), interpreted as a desire for risk-taking. The second experiment finds that tightening budgets reduces scientistsâ dissensus tolerance. Authors conclude that relaxed budgets and rewarding dissensus would encourage the production of more high-impact science.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "A Welfare Analysis of Policies Impacting Climate Change"
Abstract: This is an excellent paper that makes significant contributions to climate policy evaluation. The authors' application of the MVPF framework to analyze 96 US environmental policies provides valuable insights that traditional cost-per-ton metrics often miss. TheÂ key contribution is to develop and meticulously apply the MVPF framework to a wide range of policies, that take into account all impacts on individuals and the public.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "A Welfare Analysis of Policies Impacting Climate Change"
Abstract: Under which policy does a dollar of subsidy create the largest impact on welfare. Similarly, under which environmental tax does a dollar [of tax] collected create the lowest impact on welfare. The paper answers these questions by developing the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF). This allows [one] to rank government policies according to their welfare impacts while respecting a given government budget.

Abstract: The paper provides evidence on a recently relevant issue in science policy: the spillover effects of public science. However, these effects are not well-identified.

Abstract: This insightful and policy-relevant paper brings empirical grounding to AGI safety measures by assessing expert consensus. It finds broad support for nearly all proposed safety practices across AGI labs, governments, and civil society. Key limitations [of the paper] include potential sampling bias â particularly over-representation of safety-minded respondents â and the challenge of interpreting abstract agreement as indicative of real-world implementation.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) as a global public good, highlighting the contributions made by various countries. It successfully gathers valuable data and employs innovative methods to calculate marginal costs. However, the empirical approach could be improved by addressing omitted variable bias and incorporating general equilibrium effects.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Misperceptions and Demand for Democracy under Authoritarianism"
Abstract: Why authoritarian leaders continue to receive support despite openly agitating against democratic institutions is one of the most important puzzles of the last few decades. This paper argues that the answer is partly lack of knowledge about the costs of authoritarianism. Using an online and a field experiment, the authors show that informational treatments that remedy this lack of knowledge can have substantial effects on both beliefs and voting behavior.

Abstract: This is a strong statistical analysis of the literature on meat and animal product consumption. It shows weaker evidence than previous reviews, purportedly because of a stricter set of criteria for inclusion which focused on RCTs. The authors have not followed standard methods for systematic reviews, basing their analysis on previous meta-analyses with which they were familiar. They searched Google Scholar, not in fact a bibliographic database, in place of traditional databases like Scopus, Web of Science Core Collections, CAB Abstracts, etc.

These include improper missing data handling, unnecessary exclusion of small studies, extensive guessing in effect size coding, lacking a serious risk-of-bias assessment, and excluding all-but-one outcome per study.

Abstract: This paper reports an RCT of a taxpayer education campaign in Togo, showing increased tax knowledge, a shift in the distribution of tax payments, and higher reported revenues. The reviewer finds the study valuable in its focus on small firms and the large tax knowledge effects. It offers suggestions concerning measurement bias due to enumerator involvement in the intervention, accountability measures, and interpretation of payment effects.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: This paper uses a randomized experiment among informal firms in Togo to explore how civic tax information affects compliance and economic activity. While overall tax participation falls, the intervention leads to more accurate self-reporting among larger firms and economic expansion among smaller ones. The findings challenge standard views on tax education and offer novel insights into stateâfirm dynamics in low-capacity settings.
