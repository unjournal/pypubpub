Title: Evaluation 2 of "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: This paper reports an RCT of a taxpayer education campaign in Togo, showing increased tax knowledge, a shift in the distribution of tax payments, and higher reported revenues. The reviewer finds the study valuable in its focus on small firms and the large tax knowledge effects. It offers suggestions concerning measurement bias due to enumerator involvement in the intervention, accountability measures, and interpretation of payment effects.

Title: Evaluation Summary and Metrics: "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togoâ[1]. Both evaluations are generally positive (journal tier ratings approaching âtop field journalâ), and also offer critiques and suggestions for improvement. Both evaluators provide suggestions for the interpretation of the results and their implications, request more detail, especially about the treatment delivery, and express concerns with sample size and power.

Title: Evaluation 1 of "Asymmetry in Civic Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in Togo"
Abstract: This paper uses a randomized experiment among informal firms in Togo to explore how civic tax information affects compliance and economic activity. While overall tax participation falls, the intervention leads to more accurate self-reporting among larger firms and economic expansion among smaller ones. The findings challenge standard views on tax education and offer novel insights into stateâfirm dynamics in low-capacity settings.
