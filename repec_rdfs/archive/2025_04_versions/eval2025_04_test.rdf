Title: Evaluation 2 of "A systematic review and meta analysis of social safety nets, women’s economic achievements and agency"
Abstract: There are increasing calls for social safety nets (SSNs) to be designed and implemented to promote womenâs economic inclusion and agency, contributing to closing gender disparities globally. We investigate the extent to which SSNs achieve these goals and explore design and contextual features that promote impacts. We aggregate results from 1,067 effect sizes from 106 publications, representing 202,974 women across 42 low- and middle-income countries.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Ends versus Means: Kantians, Utilitarians, and Moral Decisions"
Abstract: Choosing what is morally right can be based on the consequences (ends) resulting from the decision â the Consequentialist view â or on the conformity of the means involved with some overarching notion of duty â the Deontological view. Using a series of experiments, we investigate the overall prevalence and the consistency of consequentialist and deontological decision-making, when these two moral principles come into conflict. Our design includes a real-stakes version of the classical trolley dilemma, four novel games that induce ends-versus-means tradeoffs, and a rule-following task.

Title: Evaluation 2 of "Forecasts estimate limited cultured meat production through 2050"
Abstract: Is it worth the effective altruism (EA) community trying to accelerate the growth of cultured meat production. Should EA just let market forces move it forward. Should EA invest directly in cultured meat R&D or identify high-leverage ways to increase funding. Or should EA just not invest in it because it is insufficiently promising.
